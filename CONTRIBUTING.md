# Contributing to Merchant Protocol Repsitories

Those that would like to contribute to a Merchant Protocol Extension may request access to the extension's repository after making a purchase of the extension.

Contributions to Merchant Protocol Extension codebases are done using the branch & pull model developed by [github](https://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github/).
This contribution model has contributors maintaining their own branch of the codebase (which can easily be synced with the main copy). The branch is then used to submit a request to the repository to “pull” a set of changes (hence the phrase “pull request”).

Bug fixes may be contributed directly to the Master Branch. Contributing branches can take the form of new components/features, changes to existing features, tests, documentation (such as developer guides, user guides, examples, or specifications), optimizations or just good suggestions. Branch names should start with the issue # describing the contribution, followed by a few keywords.

The Merchant Protocol Development Team will review all issues and requests submitted in the first in, first out order. During the review we might require clarifications from the contributor. Any pull request opened shall become an opportunity for all developers to review the contributed codebase and suggestions will be given.

## Contribution requirements

1. Contributions must adhere to [Magento coding standards](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v1.0/coding-standards/bk-coding-standards.html).
2. Pull requests (PRs) must be accompanied by a meaningful description of their purpose. A comprehensive list of additions and items to test shall be included in the pull request description. 
3. Commits must be accompanied by meaningful commit messages. There are no character limits for your descriptions.
4. PRs which include bug fixing, must be accompanied with step-by-step description of how to reproduce the bug.
3. PRs which include new logic or new features must be submitted along with:
* Unit/integration test coverage (we will be releasing more information on writing test coverage in the near future).
* Proposed [documentation](http://devdocs.magento.com) update. Documentation contributions can be submitted [here](https://github.com/merchantprotocol/documentation).
4. For large features or changes, please open an issue and discuss first. This may prevent duplicate or unnecessary effort, and it may gain you some additional contributors.
5. All automated tests are passed successfully (all builds on Travis CI must be green).

## Contribution process

If you are a new GitHub user, we recommend that you create your own [free github account](https://github.com/signup/free). By doing that, you will be able to collaborate with the Merchant Protocol development team, “branch” the repositories and be able to easily send “pull requests”.

1. Search current listed issues (open or closed) for similar proposals of intended contribution before starting work on a new contribution.
2. Review the [Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/Jonathonbyrd/85931e667473797e8bdd72e6c8f9ae21) if this is your first time contributing.
3. Create and test your work.
4. Branch the repository and when you are ready to send a pull request – follow [Create a pull request instructions](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v1.0/contributor-guide/CONTRIBUTING.html#pull_request).
5. Once your contribution is received, The Merchant Protocol Development Team will review the contribution and collaborate with you as needed to improve the quality of the contribution.
